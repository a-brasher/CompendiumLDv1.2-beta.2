<h2><a name="welcome"></a>I. Welcome!</h2>
            <h3>Welcome to CompendiumLD</h3>
            <p>CompendiumLD
is a software tool for designing learning activities using a flexible
visual interface. It provides a set of icons to represent the
components of learning activities; these icons may be dragged and
dropped, then connected to form a map representing a learning activity.
CompendiumLD is a specialised version of <a href="http://compendium.open.ac.uk/institute/about.htm">Compendium</a>,
the mind mapping or argumentation software that provides a default set
of icons for creating maps to visualise the connections between ideas.
All the facilities provided by Compendium are included within
CompendiumLD.</p>
            <p>This prototype
has been released to allow users to explore CompendiumLD and influence
and inform its development. Please provide feedback about the installation process and CompendiumLD itself on the to the <a href="http://compendium.open.ac.uk/bugzilla/enter_bug.cgi?product=CompendiumLD"> Compendium feature request and bug tracking site</a>. 
If you have any questions about CompendiumLD please contact the lead developer <a href="mailto:a.j.brasher@open.ac.uk">Andrew Brasher</a>.</p>

            <h2><a name="install"></a>II. Install CompendiumLD</h2>
            <h3><a name="installgeneral" id="installgeneral"></a>General</h3>
            <p>If
you already have the <a href="http://compendium.open.ac.uk/institute/download/download.htm">standard version of Compendium</a> installed, we
recommend that you install this prototype into another directory. </p>
   <p>CompendiumLD is a Java application, so it requires   a  Java Runtime Environment (v1.5+) to be installed. </p>
<p><em>If
you have a previous version of CompendiumLD installed we recommend that you copy your previous installation to a new folder</em> (e.g. ComendiumLD-backup) before updating the original with this new version.</p>
<h3><a name="windows"></a>Windows</h3>
            <p>You will be prompted to install the Java Runtime Environment (JRE) at the end installation process. If you are unsure, say 'yes' because if you already have the required JRE the installer will detect and use it.</p>
           
            <p>To install CompendiumLD on either Windows XP, Vista or 7, you must have ADMINISTRATIVE rights. To ensure the installer is run with the necessary privileges in Windows Vista or 7 you should right-click on the installer and select 'Run as administrator'.</p>
            <p>If you are installing onto Windows Vista or 7 you may get an error message   indicating that the Java Runtime Environment has not been installed   correctly (e.g. this <a href="#issueJava">javaw message</a>). If this occurs you will need to install the Java Runtime   Environment separately. To do so, download the latest release of the <strong>Java    Runtime Environment</strong> from the <a href="http://java.com">Java  site</a> and follow the installation instructions   provided.</p>
<h3><a name="mac"></a>Mac OS X</h3>
            <p>CompendiumLD version 1.0 for Mac OS X has been tested on 10.5 (Leopard) and 10.6 (Snow Leopard). It requires Java J2SE 5.0 Release 4 (aka 1.5.0_4) or later, which should be present as it part of Mac OS. If Java is not on your Mac you can download it using 'software update' menu). CompendiumLD should also run on for 10.4 (Tiger) but has not been tested.</p>
            <p>Once you have downloaded the relevant .dmg file from the <a href="http://compendiumld.open.ac.uk/">CompendiumLD website</a>
        website you need to double click the .dmg file to mount the disk image.
        This will open a window showing you the CompendiumLD .mpkg file. Double
        click the package file and this will run the installer. Follow the installer
        instructions.</p>
      <p>If
        you are unsure which version of Java you have installed, open a terminal
        window (inside Applications/Utilities/Terminal) and type: </p>
		<p class="code"><code>java -version</code></p>
      <p>The output from running that command will look something like:</p>
      <p class="code"><code>java version "1.5.0_07"<br>
        Java(TM) 2 Runtime Environment, Standard Edition   (build 1.5.0_07-164)<BR>
        Java HotSpot(TM) Client VM (build 1.5.0_07-87, mixed   mode, sharing)</code></p>
      <p>The text above shows that Java 1.5.0_07 is installed in this example which is fine as it is greater than the required 1.5.0_04 </p>
      <p>NOTE: Currently, due to unresolved file permission issues,
        only the user installing CompendiumLD will be able to run it, unless CompendiumLD subfolders
        have their permissions changed appropriately.</p>
      <p><span class="ciparagraphbold">TECH TIP:</span> You
        might like to be aware that Compendium sets the Memory allocation for
        the JRE up to 256mb (the default is 64mb). If you need to change this
        value for any reason, you will need to open the contents of the Compendium
        Application file using the 'Show Package Contents' option on the right-click
        menu, then open the Contents' folder and edit the VMOptions property
        in the info.plist file. Please only attempt this if you are a confident
        user.</p>

      <p> <span class="ciparagraphbold">TECH TIP:</span> In order to automatically open external files and links on the Mac,
        Compendium stores file extension and application associations in a file in  </p>
      <p class="code"><code>&lt;Compendium home folder&gt;/System/resources called LaunchApplications.properties</code>. </p>
      <p>This file is added to as the user tries to launch various file types for the
        first time and picks an application to use. We have preloaded this file with
        three type, 'www', 'http' and 'https', and we have associated them with the path
        '/Applications/Safari'. If you do not have this application or have it in
        another location, you will need to edit this file appropriately.</p>
<h3><a name="linux"></a>Linux</h3>
            <p>Once you have downloaded the relevant .tar.gz file from the <a href="http://compendiumld.open.ac.uk/">CompendiumLD web site</a>, simply unpack it. 

You can run CompendiumLD by navigating to the CompendiumLD directory and typing:</p> 
<p class="code"> <code>./compendiumLD.sh </code></p>
           <p> Compendium is a Java application, so it requires a Java Runtime Environment (1.5+) to be installed before you can run it.

<h2><a name="issues"></a>III. Known Issues </h2>
            <h3><a id="issueCLD" name="issueCLD"></a>CompendiumLD </h3>
            <p>CompendiumLD is under ongoing development and there
              are some aspects of functionality that we know are missing from
              this version:</p>
            <ul><li>The
help available via the 'Help' menu is exactly the same as for the
standard version of Compendium, i.e. it has not been updated to take
account of the additional learning design functionality avialble in
CompendiumLD.</li>
                <li>Although they may be dragged
onto the user's design window, the activities in the learning design
help pop-up create <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transclusion">transclusions</a> of existing activities. </li>
            </ul>
            <p>There
are other aspects of learning design functionality that we plan to add
to future prototypes of CompendiumLD. Further information about these
will be available from the <a href="http://compendiumld.open.ac.uk/">CompendiumLD website</a>.</p>
            <h3><a name="issueJava"></a>Java</h3>
            <p>If, when starting CompendiumLD (e.g. by double clicking the CompendiumLD icon) you get a message like 
<p class="code">Windows cannot find `javaw`</p>
<p>you should try reinstalling Java from the Java site (<a href="http://java.com/">http://java.com/</a>).<br>  
                                                </p>
<h3><a id="issuegeneral" name="issuegeneral"></a>General<span style="font-style: italic;"> (issues concerning standard Compendium functionality)</span> </h3>
            <p>When
you import a map from QuestMap with Pros and Cons, they come out as
Arguments in CompendiumLD (even though they are linked to other nodes).
</p>
            <p>Exporting to an XML file in an
off-line directory can cause the file to be corrupted. (This is a known
Windows problem). </p>
<h3><a name="issuewindows"></a>Windows</h3>
            <p>There
is a general bug with Java running on machines with some versions of
NVidia video drivers. If you have a graphics card which uses these
drivers, and experience problems running CompendiumLD, you should make
sure that you have the latest drivers installed. </p>
            <p>There
is a problem with some Tablet PCs and graphics drivers. A workaround is
to switch off Java 2D graphics. This can be done by editing the
CompendiumLD.bat file. The final line in the batch file should
resemble: </p>
            <p class=code><code>start&nbsp;/b&nbsp;javaw&nbsp;-Dsun.java2d.noddraw=true&nbsp;-Xmx256m&nbsp;-classpath&nbsp;etc..&nbsp;etc..</code></p>
